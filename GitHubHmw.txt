"This is my first gitHub transaction, adding 2 files to gitHub"

This week I created the repository github account and,
also I downloaded the slack and added myself to the account with 
other group class . I also cloned my repository link to the github
using git clone, as well as creaated a file which I added comments 
and paste it to the github account. I also used the git push 
origin master to update the code..
